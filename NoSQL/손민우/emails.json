As a 17-year Enron veteran, the question made me truly ashamed to be associated with the co-worker who asked the question.  Hindsight is always 20/20.

The deal with Blockbuster has been a \ngreat deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.\n\nI enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks \nquite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a \nsummer conference.\n\nThe young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste \nRoberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to \nCeleste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully \nconsidered.\n\nI'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current \ntime.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too \ndistant future.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nKen",

Both Jeff McMahon (deal timing) and Rick Causey (goodwill) are ready.  Andy Fastow expects to have a read from the agencies very soon (likely late today).  As soon as I hear from Andy, I will begin polling and will set the date, hopefully, for early next week.  At this time, I am not aware of any additional items that need to be addressed by the Board in the upcoming meeting.  We need to confirm the 2002 BoD calendar but can do that in the regularly scheduled meeting in Dec.  Thanks, Paula",

I suggest that you look outside the company and find a person with unqestioned experience, intelligence and integrity -- someone with close ties to the financial community -- to join you in the Chairman's office and turn things around.  This person can look the analysits squarely in the eye and tell them to back off while we get back on track.  At this point,  I don't feel that you can only rely on your people here within the company.  And I also don't see how you can take this burden wholly on your shoulders.  Bring in the help you need, at the highest levels!  Thanks for listening.  elizabeth",
